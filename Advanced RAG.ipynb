## Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview

Naive RAG involves three primary phases:

1. **Indexing**: 
   - Prepares the document collection for retrieval by cleaning and extracting relevant information from each document. This phase involves parsind and preprocessing documents, chunking the parsed documents, using an embedding model to generate vectors out of the chunks, and storing them into a vector database.
   
2. **Retrieval**: 
   - Converts the user query into a vector representation using the embedding model.
   - Compares the vectorized query with the vectors stored in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks. 

3. **Generation**: 
   - Augments the user query with the retrieved chunks into a single prompt.
   - Generates an answer to the user query using a language model based on this combined information.

## Naive RAG Pitfalls

Naive RAG presents two main types of challenges:
1. **Retrieval challenges**: selection of irrelevant chunks to query, missing crucial information.
2. **Generation challenges**: the LLM struggles with hallucination and presents issues with relevance in its output.

These challenges mainly occur due to:

1. **Limited contextual understanding**:
   - Because naive RAG focus on **keyword matching** or basic semantic search, it retrieves irrelevant or partially relevant documents to the query. For example, a query like "*...the impact of climate change on polar bears*" would retrieve documents related with *climate change* and *polars bears* but not documents that talk about both *climate change* and *polars bears*.

2. **Inconsistent Relevance and Quality of Retrieved Documents**  
   - Naive RAG may struggle with effective document ranking, which can result in irrelevant or low-quality inputs being fed into the model.

3. **Poor Integration Between Retrieval and Generation**  
   - In Naive RAG, the retriever and generator operate independently, often leading to a lack of coordination between retrieval results and generation context.

4. **Inefficient Handling of Large-Scale Data**  
   - Standard retrieval methods can be inefficient at scale, making it challenging for Naive RAG to manage large datasets. This can cause delays in finding relevant documents or result in critical information being missed due to ineffective indexing.

5. **Lack of Robustness and Adaptability**  
   - Naive RAG lacks mechanisms to handle ambiguous or complex queries effectively. When queries contain multiple or nuanced questions, Naive RAG struggles to adapt, often failing to provide comprehensive answers due to its limited flexibility.
